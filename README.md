# A Dataset of Word-Complexity Judgements from Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Adults for Text Simplification

This dataset contains word-complexity judgements from Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing adults for a lexicon of 15,000 words.

For more details about the dataset, take a look at our paper: [link coming soon]().

## The Dataset

This repository contains two files for the dataset:

1. General Lexicon DHH Annotations: each line contains a word in the lexicon, its individual ratings from 11 DHH annotators, and the average ratings among the 11 DHH annotators. Each rating is based on a scale from 1 to 6. -1 indicates that the annotator did not rate the word.
2. General Lexicon Linguistic Characteristics: each line contains the value for the linguistic features computed for each word, as explained in the paper.

Note that the files are in TSV format (separated by tabs).
